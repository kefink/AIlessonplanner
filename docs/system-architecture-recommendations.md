# AI Lesson Planner - System Architecture Recommendations

## Executive Summary
Recommendations for transforming the current HOD-centric system into a scalable, teacher-empowered, fully automated lesson planning platform.

## Current System Limitations
- Manual post-generation data entry
- HOD bottleneck in lesson generation
- Limited teacher autonomy
- Incomplete automation

## Recommended Architecture

### 1. User Management System

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```
SuperAdmin → SchoolAdmin → HOD → Teacher
```

#### User Profiles
- **Teacher Profile**: Subject specializations, classes taught, schedule
- **HOD Profile**: Department oversight, approval workflows
- **School Profile**: Term dates, timetables, roll numbers

### 2. Automated Data Collection

#### Teacher Onboarding System
```typescript
interface TeacherProfile {
  personalInfo: {
    name: string;
    employeeId: string;
    subjects: string[];
    grades: string[];
  };
  schedule: {
    termDates: DateRange;
    classSchedule: ClassSchedule[];
    currentWeek: number;
  };
  preferences: {
    lessonDuration: number;
    teachingStyle: string;
    assessmentPreferences: string[];
  };
}
```

#### Class Management System
```typescript
interface ClassInfo {
  grade: string;
  subject: string;
  rollNumber: number;
  students: Student[];
  schedule: {
    dayOfWeek: string;
    timeSlot: string;
    duration: number;
  };
}
```

### 3. Fully Automated Lesson Generation

#### Smart Context Detection
- Auto-detect current week from term calendar
- Auto-populate teacher details from profile
- Auto-calculate lesson sequence
- Auto-assign appropriate curriculum content

#### Generation Parameters (Auto-populated)
```typescript
interface AutoGenerationParams {
  // Auto-detected
  teacher: string;           // From user session
  date: string;             // From current date + schedule
  time: string;             // From class timetable
  roll: number;             // From class enrollment
  week: number;             // From term calendar
  lesson: number;           // From curriculum sequence
  
  // User-selected
  grade: string;
  subject: string;
  specificTopic?: string;   // Optional override
}
```

### 4. Teacher-Centric Workflow

#### Daily Dashboard
- **Today's Lessons**: Auto-generated based on timetable
- **This Week's Plans**: Batch generation for weekly planning
- **Upcoming Deadlines**: Assessment and reflection reminders

#### One-Click Generation
```
Teacher Login → Select Class → Generate → Ready Lesson Plan
```

### 5. Quality Assurance & Approval Workflow

#### Three-Tier System
1. **Auto-Generation**: AI creates lesson plan
2. **Teacher Review**: Quick review and customization
3. **HOD Oversight**: Periodic quality checks (not bottleneck)

#### Smart Approval
- Auto-approve standard lessons
- Flag only unusual or modified content for HOD review
- Batch approval for routine lessons

### 6. Reflection & Feedback Loop

#### Post-Lesson Workflow
1. **Lesson Delivery**: Teacher conducts lesson
2. **Quick Reflection**: Mobile-friendly reflection form
3. **AI Learning**: System learns from teacher feedback
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Better future generations

### 7. Data Architecture

#### Centralized Data Model
```typescript
interface LessonPlanRecord {
  id: string;
  metadata: {
    teacher: TeacherInfo;
    class: ClassInfo;
    timestamp: Date;
    status: 'draft' | 'approved' | 'delivered' | 'reflected';
  };
  content: {
    schemeOfWork: SchemeOfWorkEntry;
    lessonPlan: LessonPlan;
    customizations: Modification[];
  };
  workflow: {
    generatedAt: Date;
    reviewedAt?: Date;
    approvedAt?: Date;
    deliveredAt?: Date;
    reflectedAt?: Date;
  };
  analytics: {
    generationTime: number;
    modificationsCount: number;
    effectivenessRating?: number;
  };
}
```

### 8. Scalability Considerations

#### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- School-level data isolation
- Shared curriculum database
- Scalable AI processing

#### Performance Optimization
- Lesson plan caching
- Batch generation capabilities
- Progressive loading

#### Integration Capabilities
- School Management Systems (SMS)
- Learning Management Systems (LMS)
- Assessment platforms

## Implementation Roadmap
